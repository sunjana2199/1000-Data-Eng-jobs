<strong>Company Profile<br/><br/></strong><strong>Vaxcyte, Inc. (Nasdaq: PCVX) </strong>is a vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. The Company is developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. Vaxcyte’s lead candidate, VAX-24, is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) being developed for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The Company is re-engineering the way highly complex immunizations are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and our exclusively licensed XpressCFTM cell-free protein synthesis platform. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, the Company’s system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate its ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Vaxcyte’s pipeline also includes VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV candidate; VAX-A1, a prophylactic vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep infections; VAX-PG, a therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to slow or stop the progression of periodontal disease; and VAX-GI, a vaccine program designed to prevent Shigella. The Company is driven to eradicate or treat invasive bacterial infections, which have serious and costly health consequences when left unchecked. For more information, visit www.vaxcyte.com.<br/><br/>Vaxcyte, headquartered in San Carlos, CA, went public in June 2020 and currently has a team of approximately 180 employees and anticipates continued, significant growth. Following equity offerings in October 2022 and April 2023, which generated over $1.1 billion in net proceeds, the Company’s balance sheet is further strengthened to advance its pipeline of novel vaccines, including VAX-24. These financings followed positive data readouts from Vaxcyte’s Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study evaluating VAX-24 in adults aged 18-64 and Phase 2 study in adults 65 and older. The Company believes these results support a best-in-class potential for VAX-24, which was designed to replace the current standard-of-care in adults and children. VAX-24 is being investigated for the prevention of IPD, which can be most serious for infants, young children, older adults and those with immune deficiencies or certain chronic health conditions. Given the global impact of pneumococcal disease remains significant, the public health community continues to advocate for vaccines that can offer broader protection to prevent IPD. Vaxcyte’s PCV franchise, consisting of VAX-24 and VAX-31, is designed specifically to address this need and has the potential to deliver the broadest protection for this very serious disease. We believe that our PCVs could receive regulatory approval based on successful completion of clinical studies utilizing well-defined surrogate immune endpoints, consistent with how other PCVs have obtained regulatory approval in the past, rather than requiring clinical field efficacy studies.<br/><br/><strong>Summary<br/><br/></strong>We are seeking an experienced and detail-oriented Data Systems Engineer with knowledge of System administration and DevOps with on premise and cloud-based platforms to join our IT team.

<strong>Position Description<br/><br/></strong>The Center for Computational Biomedicine (CCB) is a new center within the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. Our mission is to provide cutting-edge computational capabilities, data analysis, and data integration technologies to support medical and biological research within the Medical School. Based at the Harvard Medical School Longwood Campus, we are part of a vibrant community of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose goal is to advance the boundaries of knowledge and improve patient care. The working environment combines the best features of a startup (fast pace, flexibility, flat hierarchies) with those of one of the leading medical schools (excellent benefits, outstanding opportunities for learning, great resources, name recognition).<br/><br/>CCB is looking for an individual to join the Data and Analytic Platforms Group, a group of engineers and scientists developing data warehousing and analytic solutions in support of epidemiology, healthcare economics, machine learning, and basic science research.<br/><br/>The Group works to reduce the burden on faculty by developing centrally managed and shareable data solutions to be used across research silos. We curate very large public and private healthcare utilization (insurance claims, electronic health record), multi-omics, environmental exposure, and social determinants data sets, provision access to those curated data sets, and develop analytic frameworks to accelerate reproducible academic research on top of them. Collectively these data sets contain information relating to hundreds of millions of patients.<br/><br/>This position reports to the Director of the CCB Data and Analytic Platforms Group. Primary responsibilities will include designing and implementing relational database architecture (schema, indexing, stored procedures, ETL processes, etc.) to warehouse multi-terabyte data sets in Microsoft SQL Server. This will include periodically evaluating various query performance metrics to ensure real-time availability to the research community and recommending modifications to the underlying database platform to resolve any identified issues. The bulk of this design work will be left up with the candidate, while a small portion will involve refactoring (or strategically deciding to abandon) existing ETL / indexing strategies. The data sets will be staged into a combination of proprietary schemas as well as the open-source i2b2 data model.<br/><br/>Additional opportunities will be available for the candidate to interact with individual scientific research teams to help improve their workflows.<br/><br/><strong>Basic Qualifications<br/><br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Minimum of seven years’ post-secondary education or relevant work experience <br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Additional Qualifications And Skills<br/><br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related degree preferred.
